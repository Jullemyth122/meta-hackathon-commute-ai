# CommuteAI — Complete Technical Notes, Architecture & Implementation Reference

> **Meta Hackathon — CommuteAI**
> A GPS-anchored 3D WebGPU digital twin of Philippine jeepney transport, a simulated cabin passenger counter with a proposed low-cost ESP32-camera-to-phone deployment, a smartphone GPS tracker (`/track.html`), and a grounded Meta AI operations assistant (`/api/assist`). Hardware cost, detector accuracy and financial benefits require field validation.

## Hackathon contribution, provenance and AI role

### Development dates and reused foundation

The participant guide supplied by the author lists the kickoff on **October 26, 2026 at noon Eastern Time** and the building period as **October 27–November 4, 2026**. The kickoff is October 27 at midnight in Manila. Repository history records:

- `bfd4b9a`: README initialization, October 26, 2026 at 09:06:54 +08:00, before the kickoff.
- `942c6ca`: first implementation commit, October 27, 2026 at 14:19:56 +08:00, after the kickoff and on the first stated building date.

Commit timestamps establish when work was recorded, not when every line was originally authored. **The author reports reusing a 3D foundation from their earlier code. That foundation is pre-existing work and is not claimed as a new hackathon contribution.** The exact upstream repository and file-level boundary have not been recorded here; the initial implementation commit must not be treated as proof that every included rendering asset or utility was newly created.

The author's reported hackathon work is the CommuteAI-specific transport application and integration: OpenStreetMap/OpenFreeMap mapping, driver and commuter experiences, fleet and passenger behaviour, the virtual cabin-counter experiment, phone tracking, Meta voice/context integration, route and fuel advice, and service/economics experiments. The feature inventory below links to their current implementation; it is not a line-by-line authorship audit.

**OpenStreetMap integration is a CommuteAI feature added to the reused 3D foundation, as reported by the author.** OpenStreetMap supplies geographic data, while OpenFreeMap serves the vector tiles that CommuteAI converts into roads, buildings, water and parks for its 3D twin. This choice keeps the basemap accessible without a Google Maps API key or Google Maps usage charges. [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/) offers its public tile service without registration or API keys. The cost comparison is with [Google Maps Platform's usage-based pricing and free usage caps](https://developers.google.com/maps/billing-and-pricing/overview): Google Maps is not universally paid from the first request, but billable usage can incur charges. The contribution is CommuteAI's integration and rendering of these existing mapping resources, not creation of OpenStreetMap or OpenFreeMap.

The supplied guide permits building on existing products or codebases when new contributions are clearly identified. The submission and three-minute video should explicitly disclose the reused foundation and demonstrate the newly developed CommuteAI features. Reuse alone does not establish disqualification, and these notes do not guarantee eligibility or replace the organisers' decision. The supplied copy omits the detailed scoring rubric (`[table]`), so no AI score or finalist prediction is asserted.

### What Meta AI contributes

CommuteAI is designed to turn transport state into understandable, actionable guidance for a driver or commuter speaking English, Tagalog or Taglish. Its intended benefit is easier access to relevant decisions through natural questions and voice; improved driving decisions, fare collection or advice-following have not yet been measured in a field pilot.

| Layer | Current implementation | Attribution and evidence boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spoken questions | [`api/transcribe.ts`](./api/transcribe.ts) sends recorded WAV questions to Meta transcription with language biases and local stop-name keywords. | Meta speech recognition; the default model identifier is `muse-voice-transcribe-1.0`, overridable through `META_TRANSCRIBE_MODEL`. A configured endpoint and successful live call are required to demonstrate it. |
| Contextual answers | [`api/assist.ts`](./api/assist.ts) sends the relevant screen summary and computed plan to the Meta model configured through `META_MODEL`. Its prompt requests answers in the user's language and consistent with the supplied facts. | Meta supplies language interpretation and explanation. Prompt grounding reduces opportunities for unsupported answers but does not prove they cannot occur. |
| Transport calculations | [`api/_lib/planner.ts`](./api/_lib/planner.ts) and [`src/core/advisory`](./src/core/advisory) calculate stop/pass advice, ETAs, seat estimates, queue assignments, fares and fuel estimates. | Deterministic application logic, not calculations performed or independently verified by Meta. Some answers, including trip budgets and arrival guidance, have direct deterministic paths. |
| Spoken replies | [`api/speak.ts`](./api/speak.ts), [`src/net/voice.ts`](./src/net/voice.ts) | ElevenLabs or Azure when configured, with browser speech fallback. Spoken output in this implementation is not attributed to Meta. |
| Resilience and cost control | Planner fallback, compact context, 60-second answer cache and server-only credentials. | `/api/assist` returns `source` as `meta-ai`, `deterministic-planner` or `deterministic-fallback`. Missing configuration, math mode or credit-saving mode can produce a useful answer without a Meta call. |

For a judge-facing AI demonstration, record the configured model identifier and show a successful Meta transcription and an answer with `source: "meta-ai"`. A planner fallback must be labelled as such. Cached Meta answers remain Meta-derived, but do not demonstrate a fresh inference request. Do not expose API keys in the recording or logs.

### Current feature inventory and what each feature knows

| Feature | User benefit and implementation | Current data boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenStreetMap-based 3D map | Uses OpenFreeMap vector tiles to show real roads, buildings, water and parks without a Google Maps API dependency. Tiles are decoded and converted to 3D meshes in background workers. [`tileSource.ts`](./src/map/tileSource.ts), [`tileWorker.ts`](./src/map/tileWorker.ts), [`buildTile.ts`](./src/core/map/buildTile.ts) | OpenStreetMap is the geographic data source; OpenFreeMap is the tile provider. Basemap geometry does not supply live traffic, current transit service or passenger demand. |
| Driver stop/pass guidance | Explains pickups, drop-offs, capacity and riders already covered by a jeepney ahead. [`driver.ts`](./src/core/advisory/driver.ts), [`dispatch.ts`](./src/core/advisory/dispatch.ts) | Calculated from the focused route's simulated state. It is advisory, not an automatic vehicle control system. |
| Approaching commuters | Shows known walkers/tricycle riders within 500 m of their stop, their remaining distance and ETA, and whether they are expected before the jeepney. [`approach.ts`](./src/core/advisory/approach.ts) | Distances and arrival times are calculated from simulated journeys. Meta can explain the supplied facts; it does not visually detect people down the road. Unknown arrival estimates are not treated as zero. |
| Catchable rides and seat availability | Helps a commuter avoid a jeepney that arrives before they reach the stop, or one whose seats are taken by people ahead in the queue. [`commuter.ts`](./src/core/advisory/commuter.ts), [`CommuterPanel.tsx`](./src/ui/phone/CommuterPanel.tsx) | Seats and arrival times are estimates, not reservations. Future destinations and queue order are known in the simulation; a deployment needs corresponding real inputs. |
| Arrival explanations | Answers whether people are still approaching and whether a ride can be caught. [`arrivalAdvice.ts`](./api/_lib/arrivalAdvice.ts) | An ETA comparison does not reserve a seat or instruct a driver to wait minutes for a distant rider. Current guidance says to recheck on arrival. More fares are a possible outcome to test, not a promised result. |
| Fuel and refuelling advice | Remaining fuel to a terminal, estimated savings, tank state, and reachable stations ahead on the driver's side of the route. [`stations.ts`](./src/core/fuel/stations.ts), [`DriverPanel.tsx`](./src/ui/phone/DriverPanel.tsx) | Uses bundled station data and dated DOE price ranges; expected prices are range midpoints, not live pump quotes. Advice stays on the franchise route. |
| Trip budgets and earnings | Distinguishes a full trip budget from the remaining leg; models boundary and owner-driver costs and daily earnings. [`tripBudget.ts`](./src/core/advisory/tripBudget.ts), [`earnings.ts`](./src/app/earnings.ts) | Costs and earnings depend on inputs and assumptions. Fare revenue minus diesel alone is not take-home income. |
| Network trip planning | Direct or one-transfer journeys, walking/tricycle access, directional stops and rider-category fares. [`plan.ts`](./src/core/network/plan.ts), [`TripPlanner.tsx`](./src/ui/network/TripPlanner.tsx) | Network data includes the 2015 DOTC GTFS feed and road-derived paths. Other routes use flow estimates. Current route coverage must be verified in the field. |
| Traffic-sensitive simulation | Rush-hour speeds, terminal queues, fleet spacing, working days and refuelling alter the simulated journey. [`fleetSim.ts`](./src/core/fleet/fleetSim.ts) | This is simulated traffic behaviour. No live traffic feed or Meta traffic-detection system is demonstrated. Phone GPS supplies position/speed observations, not verified city-wide congestion. |
| Phone GPS tracking | Actual browser geolocation, noise filtering, explicit vehicle confirmation and stale/lost indicators; an indoor simulated ride is also available. [`TrackerApp.tsx`](./src/tracker/TrackerApp.tsx), [`liveVehicle.ts`](./src/core/tracking/liveVehicle.ts) | A phone's position does not independently identify its vehicle, passenger count or destination. Simulated sessions are labelled. |
| Cabin sensor experiment | Virtual camera projection, detector noise/occlusion, tracking, crossing counts and visible-head correction, with a sensor lab and PiP telemetry. [`pipeline.ts`](./src/core/doorway/pipeline.ts) | Detection inputs come from projected virtual people, not real image inference. The YOLO/phone deployment is proposed, not an integrated Meta vision feature. |
| Operator twin and economics lab | Inspect a route, compare no-app/planner/planner-plus-Meta policies, and export ledgers and audits. [`EconomicsLab.tsx`](./src/ui/EconomicsLab.tsx), [`simulation results`](./docs/simulation-results/README.md) | Seeded model results, not measured savings. Some high-load scenarios reduce service; voice-driven adoption uplift is an unmeasured hypothesis. Saved result versions may differ from the current model. |

### Proposed ESP32 camera → YOLO detector → phone deployment

The intended low-cost design uses the ESP32 camera for image capture and a paired phone for detector inference, tracking and counting; the phone can then publish occupancy alongside GPS. A candidate YOLO head detector would need compatible model weights, preprocessing, runtime integration and testing on the target phone. Training or fine-tuning on suitable licensed cabin footage may be needed; this repository does not contain a completed training run, real-camera inference integration or hardware benchmark.

The under-₱600 figure below is a **component-budget target**, assuming an existing phone. It is not a verified complete installed price: mounting, power, wiring, enclosure, delivery, connectivity and maintenance must be costed. Any cheaper configuration remains a candidate until actual parts and measurements are recorded. A locally connected camera may avoid cellular video upload, but cloud updates and Meta requests still require connectivity.

The simulator supplies passenger positions, queue order and destinations directly through [`twinState.ts`](./src/app/twinState.ts). A real deployment must obtain or estimate those facts, account for people without the app, and expose uncertainty. Camera occupancy and GPS alone cannot establish how many people await a stop or where each rider will alight.

Field evidence still needed: camera counts against manual counts under varied lighting and occlusion; phone processing speed and power use; real GPS-to-dashboard operation; route/ETA accuracy; successful Meta voice/context interactions; and a corridor pilot measuring passenger waiting, service and driver costs.

## 1. Proposed Hardware Budget and Simulated Pipeline

This specification describes the hardware design that the **CommuteAI** Three.js/WebGPU simulation aims to support. Component prices and detector performance below are design assumptions, not purchase quotes or measured hardware results. A real installation and model evaluation are still required.

| Component / Layer | Proposed Spec | Indicative Component Budget (PH) | Current Implementation or Proposed Integration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Microcontroller & Camera** | **ESP32-S3-CAM (N16R8)** + **OV2640 Wide-Angle Lens (`120°–160°`)** or **ESP32-CAM + MB Base** | **₱350 – ₱550** | Modelled physically in 3D (`CabinCameraModel` in [`src/scene/DoorwayScene.tsx`](./src/scene/DoorwayScene.tsx) and [`src/scene/world/CabinCameraFeed.tsx`](./src/scene/world/CabinCameraFeed.tsx)) and optically in [`src/scene/doorway/cabinCamera.ts`](./src/scene/doorway/cabinCamera.ts) at `CABIN_CAM` (`position: (1.2, 2.12, 0)`, `lookAt: (-3.3, 0.9, 0)`, `vfov: 100°` / `~116°` horizontal at `4:3`). |
| **In-Vehicle Connection (Video)** | **Local Wi-Fi** (phone hotspot or ESP32 SoftAP) | Built-in radio; operating costs not assessed | Proposed MJPEG camera-to-phone stream. The repository currently renders virtual camera frames; real stream integration and phone compatibility remain to be tested. |
| **In-Vehicle Connection (Count Only)** | **Bluetooth Low Energy** | Board-dependent | Optional future transport if counting is available on a capable edge device. No BLE counting integration or latency measurement is demonstrated here. |
| **Phone → Cloud / Twin Link** | **Firebase Realtime Database** or same-browser **BroadcastChannel** | Depends on usage, hosting and connectivity | GPS/session transport is implemented in [`firebaseTransport.ts`](./src/net/firebaseTransport.ts) and [`loopbackTransport.ts`](./src/net/loopbackTransport.ts). Publishing physical camera occupancy is additional integration work. |
| **AI Detection Model** | Candidate **YOLO head detector** on a phone, e.g. through TensorFlow.js | Weights, data and runtime licensing/costs must be checked | [`pipeline.ts`](./src/core/doorway/pipeline.ts) models detections with assumed miss rate (`5%`), jitter (`6%`), occlusion onset (`45%`) and latency (`25–40 ms`). No YOLO inference or training is currently integrated. |
| **Frame Rate & Resolution** | Simulation target: **`QVGA (320×240)` @ `24 FPS`** | Hardware benchmark pending | Rendered into a `320×240` target in [`PipRenderer`](./src/scene/doorway/PipRenderer.tsx) and sampled on a `24 Hz` simulated camera clock in [`CabinPipeline.tick`](./src/core/doorway/pipeline.ts). These are not measured capture/inference rates on an ESP32 or phone. |

### Why Front-Ceiling Cabin Mounting + Head Detection (Instead of a Pure 90° Doorway Mount)
1. **Full-Cabin + Doorway Coverage in One Lens:** In a traditional Philippine jeepney, mounting the ESP32-S3-CAM on the **front cabin ceiling (`x = 1.2 m, y = 2.12 m, z = 0 m`)** looking back over both benches toward the rear doorway (`REAR_X = -3.1 m`) allows a single camera to see **both** people stepping through the rear doorway **and** all 14 seated passengers along the left and right benches (`SEATS = 14`, max capacity `22` with standing/extended load).
2. **Why Heads Instead of Full-Body `COCO-SSD "person"` Boxes:** From the front of a packed jeepney, seated passengers' torsos and legs overlap along each bench, causing full-body bounding boxes to merge. Because the camera is mounted high on the ceiling (`y = 2.12 m`), passengers' **heads** separate vertically in the image plane the farther back they sit, remaining distinct and countable.
3. **Self-Correcting Hybrid Count:** Doorway crossings (`boarded` / `alighted`) are combined with a steady lower bound of visible heads in the cabin (`SteadyCount`), so if two passengers board closely and one crossing is occluded, the visible head count automatically corrects the total (`corrections++`).

## 3. Step-by-Step Simulation Pipeline

The following virtual-camera and counting stages are implemented and covered by simulation tests. These tests do not establish real camera, wireless transport or detector performance:

1. **[x] Step 1: Front-Ceiling Cabin Mounting & Physical 3D Sensor Model**
   - **Implementation:** [`src/scene/doorway/cabinCamera.ts`](./src/scene/doorway/cabinCamera.ts), [`src/scene/DoorwayScene.tsx`](./src/scene/DoorwayScene.tsx), and [`src/scene/world/CabinCameraFeed.tsx`](./src/scene/world/CabinCameraFeed.tsx).
   - **How it works:** The virtual ESP32-S3-CAM is mounted at `(1.2, 2.12, 0)` in the jeepney's ground frame, looking back at `(-3.3, 0.9, 0)` with a `100°` vertical FOV (`4:3` aspect ratio). A physical 3D ESP32-S3-CAM module (mounting bracket, dark PCB, gold lens ribbon, silver OV2640 barrel, glass lens, green LED) and a toggleable **Red FOV Detection Cone** spanning from the lens (`x = 1.2`) to the rear doorway (`REAR_X = -3.1`) are rendered inside both the Sensor Lab and the Live Twin.

2. **[x] Step 2: Frame Capture at `QVGA (320×240)` @ `24 FPS`**
   - **Implementation:** [`src/core/doorway/pipeline.ts`](./src/core/doorway/pipeline.ts) (`FRAME_W = 320`, `FRAME_H = 240`, `ESP32_HEAD_DETECTOR.fps = 24`) and [`src/scene/doorway/PipRenderer.tsx`](./src/scene/doorway/PipRenderer.tsx).
   - **How it works:** `CabinPipeline.tick(nowMs, capture)` runs on the camera's own `24 Hz` clock (`period = 41.67 ms`) independent of the monitor's refresh rate. If a new frame arrives before the previous frame's `25–40 ms` inference finishes (`exposedAt < busyUntil`), the frame is recorded as `dropped`, modelling the possibility of dropped frames; the latency values are assumptions.

3. **[x] Step 3: Phone-to-Twin GPS/Session Transport (Loopback + Firebase)**
   - **Implementation:** [`src/net/loopbackTransport.ts`](./src/net/loopbackTransport.ts) and [`src/net/firebaseTransport.ts`](./src/net/firebaseTransport.ts).
   - **How it works:** Works zero-config offline across browser tabs via `BroadcastChannel` (`LoopbackTransport`), and over the internet between a real smartphone and laptop via Firebase Realtime Database (`FirebaseTransport`) with anonymous authentication and security rules ([`database.rules.json`](./database.rules.json)).

4. **[x] Step 4: 3D-to-2D Head Projection & Realistic Detector Simulation**
   - **Implementation:** `projectPerson` in [`src/scene/doorway/cabinCamera.ts`](./src/scene/doorway/cabinCamera.ts) and `CabinPipeline.detect` in [`src/core/doorway/pipeline.ts`](./src/core/doorway/pipeline.ts).
   - **How it works:** Projects each rider's 3D head center (`HEAD_CENTRE_Y = 1.40 m` scaled by posture/stoop) into the `320×240` pixel frame via `ndc.project(cam)`. Computes apparent head width from distance (`focalPx = (FRAME_H / 2) / tan(vfov / 2)`), sorts people front-to-back by depth, computes pairwise bounding-box overlap occlusion (`overlapFraction`), applies random detector misses (`missRate: 0.05` amplified by occlusion above `0.45`), and adds Gaussian centroid/size jitter (`jitter: 0.06`).

5. **[x] Step 5: Greedy Nearest-Neighbour Centroid Tracking & Doorway Side Classification**
   - **Implementation:** [`src/core/doorway/centroidTracker.ts`](./src/core/doorway/centroidTracker.ts) and `cabinSide` in [`src/core/doorway/pipeline.ts`](./src/core/doorway/pipeline.ts).
   - **How it works:**
     - `CentroidTracker` matches detections frame-to-frame using Euclidean distance + box-width difference (`maxJumpPx: 10`, `maxMissedFrames: 6`, `maxSizeRatio: 1.4`).
     - `cabinViewFor(cam)` projects the 3D rear doorway opening (`x = -3.1`) into a 2D pixel rectangle `door` and computes the reference head width at the doorway threshold (`doorHeadWidthPx`).
     - `cabinSide(box, cabin)` classifies any head outside the doorway rectangle as `'in'` (inside the cabin). For heads seen inside the doorway rectangle, it compares `box.w / doorHeadWidthPx`: `< 1.05` is `'out'` (on the street behind the door), `> 1.35` is `'in'` (stepped inside the cabin), and `1.05 .. 1.35` is `'unsure'` (hysteresis band so pixel jitter cannot cause false flips).

6. **[x] Step 6: Hybrid Doorway Transition + Steady Head-Count Floor & HUD Telemetry**
   - **Implementation:** [`src/core/doorway/occupancy.ts`](./src/core/doorway/occupancy.ts), [`src/ui/PipOverlay.tsx`](./src/ui/PipOverlay.tsx), and [`src/ui/CounterBadge.tsx`](./src/ui/CounterBadge.tsx).
   - **How it works:**
     - `DoorTransitions` requires a tracked head to stay on the new side (`'out' -> 'in'` or `'in' -> 'out'`) for `CONFIRM_FRAMES = 3` consecutive detections before incrementing `boarded` or `alighted`.
     - `SteadyCount` computes the 80th percentile of visible cabin heads over a 24-frame (`~1 s`) rolling window and requires a new level to hold for `600 ms`. Whenever `heads.value > base + boarded - alighted`, `PassengerCounter` raises `base` and increments `corrections`.
     - Live telemetry (`FPS`, `latencyMs`, `dropped`, `current`, `boarded`, `alighted`, `seenNow`, `seenSteady`, bounding boxes, track IDs, and doorway rectangle) is rendered in real time on [`src/ui/PipOverlay.tsx`](./src/ui/PipOverlay.tsx) and [`src/ui/CounterBadge.tsx`](./src/ui/CounterBadge.tsx).

## 4. Mathematical & Simulation Models

### A. Geodesy, Polyline Map-Matching & GPS Noise Rejection
- **Local Tangent-Plane Projection ([`src/core/geo/projection.ts`](./src/core/geo/projection.ts)):**
  Converts WGS84 `(lat, lng)` around the route origin `(lat0, lng0)` into local scene metres `(x = East, z = South)` using `METRES_PER_DEGREE_LAT = 111_132.92` and `cos(lat0)` longitudinal scaling.
- **Uncertainty-Gated Speed Estimation ([`src/core/tracking/gpsFilter.ts`](./src/core/tracking/gpsFilter.ts)):**
  Rejects fixes with `accuracyM > 35 m`. Over a `15 s` rolling window, displacement $d = \text{haversine}(f_0, f_n)$ is only considered significant when:
  $$d > \sqrt{\sigma_0^2 + \sigma_n^2}$$
  This prevents stationary GPS drift (e.g., two $\pm 10\text{ m}$ fixes $3\text{ s}$ apart) from producing fake $12\text{ km/h}$ vehicle speeds.
- **Trip State Machine ([`src/core/tracking/tripState.ts`](./src/core/tracking/tripState.ts)):**
  Transitions `WAITING` $\rightarrow$ `POSSIBLE_VEHICLE` only when speed $\ge 3.5\text{ m/s}$ ($12.6\text{ km/h}$) with $\ge 4$ good fixes is sustained for $12\text{ s}$ while within the route corridor. Transitions to `CONFIRMED` **only** when the rider taps confirm. Leaving the route corridor for $30\text{ s}$ resets `POSSIBLE_VEHICLE` to `WAITING`.
- **Windowed Route Matching & Pose Extrapolation ([`src/core/tracking/liveVehicle.ts`](./src/core/tracking/liveVehicle.ts)):**
  Projects GPS fixes onto the route polyline within a window $[s_{\text{last}} - 60\text{ m},\; s_{\text{last}} + 250\text{ m}]$ so loop or out-and-back routes never snap to the opposite lane. Extrapolates forward along the polyline for at most `MAX_EXTRAPOLATION_S = 2 s` and blends the rendered 3D pose with exponential smoothing ($\tau = 0.5\text{ s}$). Vehicles turn `stale` after `8 s` without a fix and `lost` after `30 s`.

### B. Multi-Segment Passenger Boarding/Alighting, Two-Bone Arm IK & Bicycle Steering Model
- **Two-Step Climb & Cabin Aisle Trajectory ([`src/core/people/riderMotion.ts`](./src/core/people/riderMotion.ts)):**
  Every boarding passenger follows continuous segments parameterized by arc-length and speed:
  1. **Approach (`1.15 m/s`):** Walk from curb/street (`x = -6.2 m`) to the road spot behind the step (`stepOutsideX`).
  2. **Two-Step Climb & Grab-Pole Reach (`CLIMB_S = 0.62 s` per step):** Step from the road onto the rear bumper step (`L.step`), lifting the leading knee (`lift`, `liftLeg`), leaning forward from the hips (`CLIMB_LEAN = 0.28 rad`), and reaching both hands onto the entrance grab poles (`reach`), then climb onto the cabin floor while ducking (`DUCK = 0.84`) so the top of the head clears the `2.04 m` doorway header.
  3. **Center Aisle (`0.85 m/s`):** Walk forward along `z = 0` stooped under the low roof (`STOOP = 0.88`, `AISLE_LEAN = 0.12 rad`) to the assigned bench row `seat.x`.
  4. **Turn (`0.40 s`):** Rotate yaw toward the opposite bench (`yaw = ∓π/2`) while shifting laterally toward `seat.z`.
  5. **Sit (`0.85 s`):** Ease `sit: 0 -> 1` (thighs rotate to $+90^\circ$, shins to $-90^\circ$) and settle into a per-person seated habit (`lap`, `phone`, or `bag`).
  Alighting executes the exact reverse trajectory (`stand up → turn → aisle → step down onto step → down to road → walk away`) with single-file doorway spacing (`DOOR_SPACING_S = 1.0 s`) so riders never overlap in the doorway.
- **9-Mesh Instanced Human Rig, Two-Bone IK & Kinematic Bicycle Steering ([`src/scene/people/personRig.ts`](./src/scene/people/personRig.ts), [`src/scene/jeepney/jeepneyGeometry.ts`](./src/scene/jeepney/jeepneyGeometry.ts), [`src/scene/jeepney/JeepneyInstances.tsx`](./src/scene/jeepney/JeepneyInstances.tsx)):**
  - All passengers and drivers across the entire scene are drawn in **9 `InstancedMesh` draw calls** (`torso`, `pelvis`, `head`, `hair`, and paired `thigh`, `shin`, `foot`, `sleeve`, `forearm`).
  - **Turning Steering Wheel Mesh (`steeringWheelGeometry`):** Drawn as its own `InstancedMesh` at `STEERING = { centre: (1.3, 0.68, -0.46), rake: 40°, radius: 0.175 }` and rotated about its raked axis each frame by the **kinematic bicycle model**:
    $$\delta_{\text{wheel}} = \text{clamp}\!\left(R_{\text{steer}} \cdot \arctan\!\left(\frac{L \cdot \omega}{\max(v, 1.5)}\right),\; -2.4,\; +2.4\right)$$
    where $R_{\text{steer}} = 14$ (`STEERING_RATIO`), $L = 4.3\text{ m}$ (`WHEELBASE_M`), $\omega$ is the vehicle's smoothed yaw rate ($\text{rad/s}$), and $v$ is smoothed ground speed ($\text{m/s}$).
  - **Analytical Two-Bone Arm IK (`RigWriter.solveArm`):** Computes exact shoulder swing, splay, and elbow flexion angles from the law of cosines so both of the driver's hands lock onto the rotating steering wheel rim at "ten-to-two" (`rimPoint(±62°, handTurn)`) within `< 2 mm`, while the driver's feet work the pedals (`pose.pedal`), the torso pivots at hip height (`HIP_Y = 0.74 m`), and the head glances into the turn.

### C. LTFRB Traditional Jeepney Fare Formula ([`src/core/fare.ts`](./src/core/fare.ts))
- Base fare: **₱14.00** for the first **4 km**, plus **₱2.00** per additional started kilometre:
  $$\text{Fare}_{\text{regular}}(d) = 14 + 2 \cdot \max\bigl(0, \lceil d - 4 \rceil\bigr)$$
- Student / Senior Citizen / PWD **20% discount**, rounded to the nearest 25 centavos:
  $$\text{Fare}_{\text{discounted}}(d) = \frac{\text{round}\bigl(0.8 \cdot \text{Fare}_{\text{regular}}(d) \times 4\bigr)}{4}$$
