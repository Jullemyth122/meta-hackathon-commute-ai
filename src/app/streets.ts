/**
 * The side streets around the focused route's stops, loaded from the map's
 * vector tiles and handed to the twin's riders: where people come from and
 * go to (core/people/streetGraph.ts). A worker fetches the tiles and builds
 * them (map/streetsWorker.ts), so a long route's few hundred thousand
 * street points never freeze the twin; the page only puts the result back
 * together.
 *
 * Loaded once per route and kept, so going back to a route is instant.
 * Until they are in (or if the tiles cannot be had: offline), riders come
 * along the route's pavement as before.
