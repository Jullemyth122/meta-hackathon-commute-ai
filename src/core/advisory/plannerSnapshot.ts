/**
 * What the assistant (/api/assist) is told, in the server planner's format
 * (RawSnapshot in api/_lib/planner.ts).
 *
 * The planner thinks in one straight line: stops at km marks, jeepneys at km
 * marks, everyone driving towards higher km, stops found by name. Our route
 * is a loop, so it is cut open at a point that suits the question:
 *
 *   driver     at the jeepney, so it is at 0 km.
 *   commuter   just after their destination, so the destination is the last
 *              stop and their stop comes before it.
 *   operator   at the start of the route.
 *
 * Only what the person's own screen is about goes in: what is sent to Meta
 * grows with every jeepney and stop in here.
 *
 *   driver     their jeepney and the next stops on their screen (3 stops or
 *              1.5 km, as driver.ts), with the jeepneys between them, which
 *              get to those stops first and take their riders.
 *   commuter   the jeepney they ride, or the next ones coming to their stop
 *              (the arrivals on their screen), and the stops from there to
 *              their destination.
 *
 * Leaving the rest out changes no number: a jeepney further ahead has
 * already passed those stops, one further behind gets there after.
 *
 *   operator   (the Live twin, no jeepney selected) the whole route and
 *              fleet, at their real positions; /api/assist sends Meta only
 *              the fleet totals and the busiest stops from it.
 *
 * Names are made unique ("Name → towards", then a number), because the
 * planner matches stops by name and a loop passes some names twice.
