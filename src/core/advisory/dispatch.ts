/**
 * First come, first served: which jeepney picks up whom.

 * Every jeepney heading to a stop where people wait is a "visit". Visits are
 * handled nearest first, so the jeepney that gets there first claims the
 * queue, up to the seats it will have free on arrival (its riders getting off
 * on the way free seats; people it has already claimed at earlier stops take
 * them). Whoever is left waits for the next jeepney. No two jeepneys are ever
 * sent for the same people, and a driver can see that a crowd is covered.
