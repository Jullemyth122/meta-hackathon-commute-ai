/**
 * Jeepneys on the routes nobody is looking at closely: a flow, not a
 * simulation. Positions and loads are worked out from the clock alone, so
 * tens of thousands of jeepneys across Metro Manila cost nothing until they
 * are drawn or asked about, and they are the same whichever frame asks.
 *
 *   speed     commercial speed (stops included) by time of day: slower in
 *             the rush hours, faster at night.
 *   fleet     one jeepney every headway (GTFS) round the loop.
 *   day       as the twin's jeepneys. Some boundary drivers collect the
 *             jeepney at the operator's terminal, sent out by the dispatcher
 *             one after another between 5:30 and 6:30 AM; the rest, and the
 *             owner-drivers, set out from a garage or home along the route at
 *             a time of their own. Terminal to terminal they drive; at each
 *             terminal they wait in the line 2 to 5 minutes before the trip
 *             back. Between 9 and 11 PM each knocks off: the trip under way is
 *             finished, then one kept at a terminal stays at that terminal and
 *             the rest drive back to their garage or home the short way
 *             (wherever the route next passes it). Times change day to day.
 *   load      by time of day (the commute peaks), varying smoothly per
 *             jeepney over ten minutes or so.
 *   seats     for someone arriving at a stop: free seats less the people
 *             already queued there, who board first.
 *
 * These are estimates of how a route usually runs, not live data, and the
 * app says so wherever it shows them.
