 *   - 10–15 riders on board on average (MMDA, via IBON); trips ~5 km.
 *     Quirino Highway is Metro Manila's busiest radial road.
 *
 * The simulator now runs a working day at the road's speeds (rush-hour
 * traffic, terminal lines: FleetSim.dayCycle), so it takes the published
 * figure: 300 riders per jeepney a day. Measured on the Tungko–SM Fairview
 * loop with 60 jeepneys (28 Oct 2026): ~11 on board at the rush, ~4 at
 * midday, 128 km and 29 L of diesel a day, ₱700 net after the ₱700
 * boundary, inside the ₱400–800 drivers report.
