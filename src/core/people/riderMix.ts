/**
 * Who rides, when and where: the shares of regular, student, senior, PWD
 * and pregnant riders change through the day, the week and from stop to
 * stop, around the day's average (the base mix). So one jeepney can fill
 * with students at a school at 6:30 while the next one, at 10, carries
 * seniors to the market.
 *
 *   hour   students ride to school 6–8 AM and home 3–6 PM, few at night;
 *          seniors from mid-morning to mid-afternoon, off the rush; PWD
 *          riders a little more off the rush too.
 *   week   day 0 (day 1 of the month) is a Monday, an assumption. On
 *          Saturdays and Sundays few students ride, a few more seniors.
 *   stop   at a school's stop, students are several times as common once
 *          classes let out (from SCHOOL_OUT_H); in the morning they come
 *          to it (the twin's destinations) more than they leave it.
 *   day    each day every kind's share wanders by up to DAY_SWING either
 *          way, so no two days are alike.
 *
 * `calibrate` keeps the base meaning what it says, the share of a weekday's
 * riders as a whole, while the hours and stops move around it. All of this
 * is a simulation assumption, not survey data.
