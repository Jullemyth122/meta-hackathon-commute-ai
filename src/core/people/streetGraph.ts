 *
 *   graph      junctions and bends are nodes, street segments are edges.
 *              Vector tiles split streets at tile edges, and often draw a
 *              side street up to another without a point in common, so ends
 *              left dangling are joined to any node, else any street,

 *              is a way in to it: out of the street onto the stop's pavement
 *              (over the road, from the far side) and along it.

 *              stop its people use: the nearest by street, by the side
 *              streets (not along national roads). Far neighbourhoods come
 *              to the stop their streets lead to.

 *              app's rider) joins the nearest street that leads somewhere,
 *              and goes the way its neighbourhood goes; or, when that stop
 *              does not take them where they are going, the shortest way
 *              by any street, national roads' pavements too (wayFrom).
 *
 * The graph runs along street centre lines; people are put beside them (see
 * Lane): on foot at the street's edge, just off the road as drawn, and by
