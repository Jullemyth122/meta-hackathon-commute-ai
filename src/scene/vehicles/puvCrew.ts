/**
 * Riders in a modern jeepney, UV Express or bus: their seats (from the
 * model, vehicleGeometry.ts), the order they take them, which door they use,
 * and how they move inside. The same PassengerLayout the jeepney has
 * (jeepney/crewState.ts), so the passenger system runs all of them alike.
 *
 *   modern jeepney  in and out at its one door; benches along the walls,
 *                   sat on from the aisle, as in a jeepney (with headroom)
 *   bus             in at the front door, out at the middle one; rows of
 *                   two, window seats first, then the aisle seats
 *   UV Express      the two seats beside the driver from the cab door; the
 *                   rows from the sliding door, crouched and squeezing
 *                   ("siksikan"): ducking through the low doorway, bent
 *                   double under the 1.55 m roof, a hand on the seat backs,
 *                   shuffling sideways along a row; the back row first and
 *                   the far seat of each row first, so nobody climbs over
 *                   anyone already sitting
