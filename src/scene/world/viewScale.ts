/**
 * Map-style symbol scaling: a 7 m jeepney is under a pixel when you look at a
 * 6 km route, so vehicles and stop pins grow as the camera pulls back.
 * Close up (street view, ride-along) everything is true to scale.
 *
 * The enlargement is for the main view only. A camera that stands for a real
 * sensor (the cabin camera) must see true sizes, or it would sit inside a
 * swollen jeepney looking at giant neighbours. So whatever is drawn
 * view-scaled registers a "pose at scale k" function (useScaledPose), and
 * the picture-in-picture pass re-poses the scene at scale 1 for its camera
 * and back at the view scale for the main camera (poseAtScale).
